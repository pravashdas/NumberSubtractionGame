# Number Subtraction Game

## Overview
The Number Subtraction Game is a simple Python program that engages users in a game involving two-digit numbers. The user is prompted to imagine a 2-digit number that is not divisible by 11, flip that number, and subtract from greater to smaller digits. The script calculates the result and displays it in an interactive manner.

## Features
- User input validation for a single-digit left-hand side digit.
- Dynamic calculation of the right-hand side digit.
- Display of the subtraction result with the larger digit first.
